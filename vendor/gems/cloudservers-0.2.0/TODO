* There are caching bugs in the API, so that accurate information is not always returned (ie. if you add a server and
  then list available servers, the new one will not show up.).  That needs to be corrected on the API end before
  data will be accurate.

* Allow some sort of flag to get the stack trace when an exception is thrown.

* Shared IP group modification code.

* Support the changes-since parameter.

* Tests.  Accusations of heresy and/or apostasy are expected.  :-)
